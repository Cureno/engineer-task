- where to deploy? buy domain? https? github pages, maybe?

- which font? Arial? sans-serif? Roboto? google-fonts? download or link?
- what colors to use? can't reproduce the colors with the color picker
- how to structure the css? does it matter? child-selectors or more classNames ?
- use CSS-grid?

- where to put the state? maybe wrap the MultiInput in some
   
      <StateProviderSomething>
            <MultiInput {...allThePropsNeeded} />
      </StateProviderSomething>                             ???

- where to put the functions to update the state?

      <StateAndUpdaterProviderWhatever>
            <MultiInput {...allThePropsAndFunctionsNeeded} />
      </StateAndUpdaterProviderWhatever>                             ???
